# Bayesian-Deep-Learning-Clarotto-Franchini-Lamperti
In this project we aim at comparing a Bayesian Neural Network trained with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and a MC Dropout Neural Network focusing on regression problems

INSTALLATION GUIDE
In the bayes_reg.py implementation we used an external package called "hamiltorch" which we used to train the NN with the Hamiltonian MC method. To install it you have to execute the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/AdamCobb/hamiltorch.git

cd hamiltorch

pip install .
